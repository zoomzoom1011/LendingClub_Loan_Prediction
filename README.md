# LendingClub_Loan_Prediction

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans.

In this project, I will use supervise machine learning method for classification problem: predict the loan will be either 'charge off' or 'fully paid'.
